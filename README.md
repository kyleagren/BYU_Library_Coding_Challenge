# BYU Library Coding Challenge

I decided to go with option 2 because I enjoy the thought challenge of this type of question a bit more. I also prefer to work in JS than mess around
with HTML/ CSS if given the choice, although I'm fine with all of it. 

The one that took the longest was the recursion one, although the final solution is quite short so it doesn't really indicate the trial and error very well, sorry. 

I'd be happy to elaborate further on any of the functions. 

I apologize if the format isn't quite what expected, the challenge just said to write the functions but not what to do with them, so they are all just in a .js file.
